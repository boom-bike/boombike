Initially created (3 years ago) using Python 2.6.6 and Django 1.5.4, one of the greatest improvements would be to switch to Python 3 and Django 1.9. And why not using Dajngo CMS here so anyone could afford to provide content for the website?
This is an old personal project still going on and that needs supports from developing to translating. Experience with GitHub managed projects would be greatly appreciated as well.
