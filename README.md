# boombike

This repo contains source code for the website boom-bike.info. 
This is a community driven project promoting the use of bicycles to go to Boom Festival but also in our everyday life.

Feel free to fork and send PRs, contributions are welcome !

## Technical information
Created three years ago using Python 2.6.6 and Django 1.5.4, one of the greatest improvements would be to switch to Python 3 and Django 1.9. And why not using Dajngo CMS here so anyone could afford to provide content for the website?
This is an old personal project still going on and that needs supports from developing to translating. Experience with GitHub managed projects would be greatly appreciated as well.

## Roadmap
* Update layout to use official Boom materials (images, fonts etc.)
* Switch to Python 3, Django 1.9 and django CMS
* Provide admin for the few existing models
* Use settings and local_settings mecanism in order to make developement easier and avoid sensitive information leaks
