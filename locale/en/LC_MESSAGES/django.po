msgstr "What is bicycle touring?"

msgid "bicycle_touring"
msgstr "<p>Above all it is about tourism. So bicycle touring is travelling by bike out of our usual"
       " everyday life environment. But here, cycling is much more than an activity and a way to"
       " lift yourself: it is an open door to the world and it moves you closer to locals.</p>"
       "<p>Choosing bicycle to travel also means accepting to move much slower than by car or by plane."
       " Patience is required to slowly ride to a remote area and spend the night there, then do it"
       " again the next day. You will have plenty of time to appreciate everything that comes across"
       " your path. It is an excellent opportunity to live freely and share simple moments of happiness.</p>"
       "<p>Hanging around, having some physical exercise, feeling free, travelling eco-friendly… These all"
       " accurately describe well bicycle touring. But you know, it is nothing like shopping at the grocery"
       " store down the street. It requires knowing where to sleep and how, what to eat or"
       " cook, which route to take… Ultimately, it is more than making a shopping list!</p><p></p>"

msgid "bicycle_trekking"
msgstr "<p>Trekking is a much closer to a pure physical activity than a touring trip. It usually is"
       " an intense sport challenge which requires efforts done in a limited time frame (it"
       " generally does not exceed a few days in a row). Thus, bicycle trekking is not to be"
       " mistaken with bicycle touring: a good performance is usually expected over a short period"
       " of time, contrary to the laid back state of mind in bicycle touring.</p>"
       "<p>Trekking difficulty justifies reliable and efficient gear, that is why bicycle tourers"
       " can find loads of information and borrow most of the equipment used to practice this"
       " activity. The main ones could be ultra-light tent, camping stove and orientation devices."
       " If it is possible to get rid of such technicality, it makes every day more enjoyable by"
       " allowing you to cook anywhere at any time or quickly find the right directions.</p>"
       "<p>If there are a lot of logistic questions to be answered to plan a bike trip, cycle"
       " tourers should also bring all the equipments required according to their route and their"
       " own goals.</p>"

msgid "get_fitted"
msgstr "<p>It is well known that cycling is a physical activity which has many benefits, gives"
       " stamina and improves tone. Moreover, anybody can enjoy it, no matter what age or what"
       " physical fit. On top of that, there is no contraindication for this practice. No excuse!</p>"
       "<p>Morphology is the only one element that is of great importance. It has"
       " huge impacts in choosing the right bike. It is also very important to adjust bike parts"
       " in order to avoid injuries. Once this is done, you can ride with confidence for months!</p>"

msgid "closer_to_locals"
msgstr "<p>Somehow, cycling is of a strange way to travel."
       " Bikers generally create curiosity and admiration. Most of the time, the people cyclists"
       " meet on the road ask a lot of questions about the trip and personal motivations. They get"
       " stunned when they see someone traveling that slowly by pedaling in this era. This allows"
       " bikers to ask questions back and quench their thirst in turn.</p>"
       "<p>Your bike and your smile are your best assets to meet others!</p>"
