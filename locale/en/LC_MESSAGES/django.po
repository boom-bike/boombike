msgstr "What is bicycle touring?"

msgid "bicycle_touring"
msgstr "<p>Above all it is about tourism. So bicycle touring is a leisure activity, a journey or"
       " holiday away from our everyday life and environment, where cycling is the main activity."
       " But here, cycling is much more than a mode of transport or a sporting activity: it is a"
       " way to lift yourself, it is an open door to the world and it gets you closer to locals.</p>"
       "<p>As opposed to road cycling (where the goal is covering the maximum milage in the fastest"
       " time), bicycle touring is about taking your time: the time to  admire the countryside, to"
       " talk to strangers over dinner, to really experience another culture, to exchange glances,"
       " to steal a smile...</p>"
       "<p>Choosing the bike as your mode of transport also means accepting a much slower pace than"
       " by car or by plane. Patience is required to slowly bike it to a remote area and spend the"
       " night there, then do it again the next day. You will have plenty of time to appreciate"
       " everything that you come across on your way. It is an excellent opportunity to truly live"
       " and share simple moments of happiness.</p>"
       "<p>Hanging around, physical exercise, freedom, eco-friendly travel… In the end all these"
       " are a good description of bicycle touring. But it is nothing like shopping at the corner"
       " shop. It requires preparation: knowing where to sleep and how; what to eat or cook; which"
       " route to take… Ultimately, it is more than making a simple list!</p>"

msgid "bicycle_trekking"
msgstr "<p>Trekking is a much closer to a pure physical activity than a touring trip. It is usually"
       " more of a sporting challenge which requires an intense amount of effort over a relatively"
       " short period of time (usually no more than a few day). Bicycle trekking is therefore not"
       " to be confused with bicycle touring: a good performance is usually expected contrary to"
       " the slow travelling touring state of mind.</p>"
       "<p>Trekking’s difficulty requires reliable and high-performance equipment, which is why"
       " bicycle tourers can find loads of information and borrow most of the equipment used to"
       " practice this activity: ultra-light tents, camping stoves and orientation equipment."
       " Once we get around these technicalities, it makes every day more enjoyable by allowing you"
       " to cook anywhere at any time or quickly find the right directions.</p>"
       "<p>There are a lot of logistical questions to be overcome in planning a bike trip, so cycle"
       " tourers should also bring all the equipment required according to their route and their"
       " own goals.</p>"

msgid "get_fitted"
msgstr "<p>It is well known that cycling is a physical activity which has many benefits, building"
       " stamina and improves tone. What’s more anybody can enjoy it, there’s no need to be a"
       " fitness fanatic to have fun! And the cherry on the cake, there are no drawbacks so no"
       " excuse!</p>"
       "<p>Posture is the one thing to be careful of. Choose the right bike and make the right"
       " adjustments and you will be able to ride in peace, pain-free for months!</p>"

msgid "closer_to_locals"
msgstr "<p>For some reason cycling is a unique way to travel. Cyclists generally rouse curiosity"
       " and admiration. Most of the time the people we meet along the way ask a lot of questions"
       " about the trip and are amazed at our choice to travel so slowly and by pedal-power in this"
       " day and age! This allows us cyclists to ask our own questions in return while they let"
       " their guard down. We therefore learn a lot about these people and their surroundings to"
       " satisfy our own curiosity.</p>"

       "<p>2014 is the celebration of its 10th edition! It is a great success for this activist"
       " festival which opened to other alternative cultures, ecology and art. Indeed, the Boom is"

       " amongst the numerous things to do , from chilling out at the beach to chatting at a live"
       " conference.</p>"
