msgstr "Above all it is about tourism. So bicycle touring is travelling by bike out of our usual"

" lift yourself: it is an open door to the world and it gets you closer to locals.\n\n"
"Choosing bicycle to travel also means accepting to move much slower than by car or by plane."
" Patience is required to slowly bike it to a remote area and spend the night there, then do it"
" again the next day. You will have plenty of time to appreciate everything that comes across the"
" path. It is an excellent opportunity to truly live and share simple moments of happiness.\n\n"
"Hanging around, having some physical exercise, feeling free, travelling eco-friendly... These all"
" describe well bicycle touring. But you know that it is nothing like shopping at the grocery"
" store at the corner of the street. It requires knowing where to sleep and how, what to eat or"
" cook, which route to take... Ultimately, it is more than making a simple list!"
